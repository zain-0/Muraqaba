the project works like this, there are 4 roles serviceCreator, supervisor, vendor and purchaseManager. after login every role has a different dashboard. Let me explain service creator flow first, its dashboard has Total Tickets, Pending Approval Tickets, In Progress, Completed. below it is active tickets which are shown with full detail and are marked as enum: ['pending', 'approved', 'acknowledged', 'invoiceSubmitted','invoiceAccepted' ,'completed', 'invoiceRejected'] . on clicking on a ticket it would show bus info, timeline of creation, approved etc. the service creator creates a ticket by filling the form and then the supervisor approves it, then the vendor acknowledge it and the supervisor can accept or reject it, and in case of rejection the vendor would submit again and when the supervisor accepts it, the vendor can turn it to complete. you can ask any questions related to flow for better understanding
